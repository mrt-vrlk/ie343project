1-	According to given dataset, if we increase the cooling rate average execution time decreases because the temperature drops faster compared to a smaller cooling rate. Therefore we can reach stopping temperature with less number of iteration. Since each iteration effects the execution time if we increase the cooling rate the algorithm reachs the stoping  condition with less iterations.

2-	As the difference between starting temperature and stoping temperature increases, quality of solution and execution time increase because as the difference gets bigger we have a wider range of solutions to check. Since the range is wider required number of iterations increase. Therefore, average execution time increases. Quality of solution increases as well because the algorithm needs to check a bigger feasible region more find an optimal solution. Although the size of the feasible region may proivde a better solution, this doesnâ€™t necesserily mean that the solution will get better.
